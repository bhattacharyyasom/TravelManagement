# TravelManagement
A Travel Management System using DDD with JPMS

This is a sample project to practice DDD using Java Modules.
As , getting a gradle build going is so hard with Java Modules project I am using the great plugin https://github.com/java9-modularity/gradle-modules-plugin.

Using a later Gradle version 6.5 (Dont use a later version as of this writing as there are known issues)
Tested using Java 11.
